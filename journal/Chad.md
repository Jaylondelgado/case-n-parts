Today I worked on:

- Scaling down the project a bit to be more in scope for the time we have.
- Getting the project running on Docker.

Me and my fellow team members talked about the project and the scale of what we were making.
We decided to scale back some of the features we had, so that we could make it in the
alloted time.

We also worked on setting up Docker for the project together so we could all start pairing
and working on different parts of the project.

We decided that 2 of us would start on the skeleton of the front end, and 2 of us would start
bringing the data into the back end.

Today, through many errors, I solidified some of the knowledge that I have of a Dockerfile.
Specifically, the context part of the file.

Discovered the Commander package, which lets you make your own command line utilities and commands.
