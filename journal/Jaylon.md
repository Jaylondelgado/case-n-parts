Today I worked on:

* Creating the Docker-compose.yml file and installing requirements to be ready for next week.

We worked on creating the webscraper and had to debug in order to get it to pull and show the exact data we need. We went on Excalidraw and drew out the data models and got a good idea on what needed to be scaled back.
