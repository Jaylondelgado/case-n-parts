* Creating the Docker-compose.yml file and installing requirements to be ready for next week.

We worked on creating the webscraper and had to debug in order to get it to pull and show the exact data we need. We went on Excalidraw and drew out the data models and got a good idea on what needed to be scaled back.

* Project Scaling and refactoring

The team started off the day with a meeting to gather everyones thoughts and progress thus far. After talking with everyone, we decided to scale the project down a bit and upscale as we move along. We refactored in order to have all pc parts connect to the case that we are "selling".

* Authentication and More fullstack coding

Today started off with a meeting with Curtis and he quickly filled us in on how the authentication works. After replacing his code with code that works with our models and queries, we got it fully working and you can now create multiple users, login, signout, and the password is hashed out. After doing that, with the help of the team we were able to create and list builds in Insomnia. I then created a file to fetch the builds in our data to the front end, which is currently fully functioning.

* Working on FastAPI

Today started off with Jarett catching me up with his code on the back end. I then worked on implementing the PUT request for the builds which was not an easy thing to implement but i got some of it done. There was a lot of debugging and trial and error. I ended the day being able to update everything except the case parts of the build. I kept getting an error saying syntax error near case.
