Took some time learning a few packages (Axios, Cheerio, Express) as we were unable to source an API to pull product data from.

Worked together with team to refine the scope of our project, scaling down some ideas for now until we get the main parts of the model dialed in. Drafted a design for our models of entities, value objects, and bounded contexts.
